# INF6027_musicdata
The analysis for INF6027 project and INF4000 about music data. It is not only the coursework, it is also my interests in music. It is the motivation why I choose this topic. To anyone who learn statistics, data analysis, data science, I hope this work is enjoyable. 

##Cracking the Code of Hit Songs: A Data Journey
This project explores the magic behind hit songs using the MusicOset dataset, diving into features like danceability, energy, and lyrical themes. By combining data science and music analysis, we uncover the patterns that drive song popularity. Letâ€™s decode the rhythm of success!

## Research Questions
1. What do visualizations reveal about the distribution of song features between hit and non-hit songs?
2. How can genre visualizations help identify the features influencing song popularity?
3. What patterns in lyrical themes create successful songs?

## Key Findings
- **Feature Distribution**: Songs with higher danceability, valence, and loudness tend to be more popular.
- **Genre Analysis**: Different genres prioritize specific features. For example, Dance Pop favors danceability, while Album Rock emphasizes valence.
- **Lyrical Themes**: Positive songs often focus on love and empowerment, while negative songs highlight themes of loneliness and despair.

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Clone this repository 
2. Install required R packages: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `wordcloud2`, `tidytext`.
3. Run the `music_data.R` script for visualization and analysis.
